CONFIGURATION

Navigate to the following directory 'C:\Program Files (x86)\SingularStudios\OverlayTicker\Configuration'

In this directory you will find 2 files.

Configuration.txt and TextToShow.txt

The TextToShow.txt file contains some example text. In order to place your messages in here you will need to follow the following format:
"<message>" <time in minutes to display>
  
In the Configuration.txt you will find configuration settings which include:
Frames per Second
Font Size
Font Color
Scroll Speed


In the Configuration file there are instructions and examples on how to change these settings.

KNOWN ISSUES:

If you click off your Chrome window the overlay will disapear until you reclick the Chrome window. (note that the timer will still tick for changing the message)

Make sure you have in focus the Chrome window that you would like to display the overlay on after starting the program. If you click another window it will only appear on that window.

Share your whole monitor when using this application as the overlay exists on the monitor over the Chrome window NOT the Chrome window itself. If you display only the Chrome tab the overlay will not be broadcast to who you are sharing to.


If you run into issues please feel free to put in the issues the bug that you see and I will prioritize it and attempt to fix it.
